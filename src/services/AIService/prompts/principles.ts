**Principles for Creating Effective Flashcards:**

1. **Be Context-Independent and Self-Contained**
   - Include all necessary context within the question.
   - Specify events, individuals, and terms fully.
   - Ensure the flashcard stands alone without external references.

2. **Be Covert**
   - Avoid giving away the answer in the question.
   - Provide sufficient context without overconstraining the answer.

3. **Be Focused**
   - Concentrate on one specific detail per flashcard.
   - Maintain clarity on the exact information being tested.

4. **Be Precise and Comprehensive**
   - Be explicit to avoid ambiguity.
   - Use full names, titles, and specific identifiers.
   - Include relevant dates, locations, and background information.

5. **Produce Consistent Answers**
   - Design questions to elicit the same response every time.
   - Avoid introducing variability in interpretation.

6. **Be Tractable**
   - Make questions approachable to encourage correct answers.
   - Break down complex tasks or add cues if necessary.
   - Balance difficulty without making questions trivial.

7. **Be Effortful**
   - Ensure retrieval requires meaningful cognitive effort.
   - Avoid making answers too easy or quickly inferred.
   - Aim for concise answers that capture essential information.

8. **Favor Granularity**
   - Create multiple focused flashcards rather than comprehensive ones.
   - Break complex topics into smaller, manageable pieces.
   - Target specific, discrete facts or concepts on each card.

**Key Guideline:**

- **Provide Brief and Direct Answers**
  - Keep answers as concise as possible, even if not in full sentences.
