export const augmentQuotePrompt = `You are given a flashcard consisting of a question and an answer. Your task is to locate a quote from the surrounding context that directly supports the answer. The source material may include text from multiple pages, but in most cases the most relevant passage will appear within the section marked <current page>. Focus your search there first. You are not being asked to summarize or paraphrase, but to extract—to find a sentence or short excerpt that could plausibly serve as a citation or textual grounding for the answer.

Once you have identified the best supporting sentence or phrase, include a small amount of surrounding context—typically the sentence before or after—so the quote reads fluently and is not a fragment. Your goal is to provide a quote that is precise, concise, and semantically self-contained. If you find the exact phrase in the text that matches the answer, highlight it by wrapping it in <strong>...</strong> tags. Only the portion that directly supports the answer should be emphasized this way; the rest of the quote should simply provide context, not be marked.

If the source text includes PDF artifacts—such as errant line breaks, hyphenations, broken formatting, or duplicated words—clean them up. The final quote should read naturally, as if it came from a well-formatted book or article. Do not quote multiple paragraphs, and do not include content that is only loosely related to the answer.

Once complete, return the text of the quote and include nothing else in your output. If you cannot find anything in <current page>, search elsewhere in the full context, but never fabricate or infer—your quote must be grounded in the actual text. Never hallucinate.`;
